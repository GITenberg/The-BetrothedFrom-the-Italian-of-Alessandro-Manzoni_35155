description: '"Set in Lombardy during the Spanish occupation of the late 1620s, The
  Betrothed tells the story of two young lovers, Renzo and Lucia, prevented from marrying
  by the petty tyrant Don Rodrigo, who desires Lucia for himself. Forced to flee,
  they are then cruelly separated, and must face many dangers including plague, famine
  and imprisonment, and confront a variety of strange characters the mysterious Nun
  of Monza, the fiery Father Cristoforo and the sinister Unnamed'' in their struggle
  to be reunited. A vigorous portrayal of enduring passion, The Betrothed''s exploration
  of love, power and faith presents a whirling panorama of seventeenth-century Italian
  life and is one of the greatest European historical novels"--P. [4] of cover.'
